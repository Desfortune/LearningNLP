Some Tutorials and in depth analysis of NLP's techniques / algorithms


## 1st Tutorial 

### Topics 
* Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression 
* Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes 

### Possible Ideas: 

**(Simo)** 
* Scrape or Find a small-size dataset (maybe from [Kaggle-Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)), randomly sample some text from it and build a logistic regression / naive bayes classifier 
* Maybe we can take a look in depth into some explainability criteria, e.g. SHAP (shapley value) [SHAP + Sentiment Analysis](https://slundberg.github.io/shap/notebooks/linear_explainer/Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.html),  [Shapley Values](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html), [LIME](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html#lime) 
* **(Luca B.)** Maybe we can use the arxiv dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv) and use the abstract to extract the cateogry. It could be useful to explore this dataset because it can be used for more advanced projects later.
